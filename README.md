Fetching product details from John Lewis API

In order to get all products information from the Home page John Lewis API with coffee machine, I have used Selenium package in Python by taking the advantage of scrollHeight

Dumped the details in a table called Product_details using SQLite3, it contains [Product_ID],[Brand],[Product_name],[Price],[Ratings],[Reviebws],[Promotions],[Product_link]

Gathered each product specifications using Beautiful soup and Requests library.

Dumped the data in Product_specifications table




Also, can find the data in SSMS tables
